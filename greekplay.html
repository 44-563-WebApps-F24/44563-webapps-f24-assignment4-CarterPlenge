            Carter presents a Greek play by Sophocles
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Oedipus at Colonos by Sophocles
        </h2>
        OED. Well, may he come to bless his city and me!
        When hath not goodness blessed the giver of good?

        ANT. O Heavens! What shall I say, what think, my father?

        OED. Daughter Antigone, what is it?

        ANT.                                I see
        A woman coming toward us, mounted well
        On a fair Sicilian palfrey, and her face
        With brow-defending hood of Thessaly
        Is shadowed from the sun. What must I think?
        Is it she or no? Can the eye so far deceive?
        It is. 'Tis not. Unhappy that I am,
        I know not.--Yes, 'tis she. For drawing near
        She greets me with bright glances, and declares
        Beyond a doubt, Ismene's self is here.

        OED. What say'st thou, daughter?

        ANT.                             That I see thy child,
        My sister. Soon her voice will make thee sure.

        _Enter_ ISMENE.

        ISMENE. Father and sister!--names for ever dear!
        Hard hath it been to find you, yea, and hard
        I feel it now to look on you for grief.

        OED. Child, art thou here?
